### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Changing Trend and Sentiment of Lyrics
+ This project is conducted by [Haoyu Shang]

+ Project summary: Music is an indispensable part of our daily life. In this report, I analyze the change of lyrics from 1970 to 2010 and learn the information hidden behind the change. Also, I learn about the sentiment expressed by lyrics. This report mainly uses descriptive statistical methods.
